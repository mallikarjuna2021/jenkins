How jenkins works
-----------------

First, a developer commits the code to the source code repository. ... Soon after a commit occurs, the Jenkins server detects the changes that have occurred in the source code repository. Jenkins will pull those changes and will start preparing a new build. If the build fails, then the concerned team will be notified


why we use jenkins
------------------

Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build
